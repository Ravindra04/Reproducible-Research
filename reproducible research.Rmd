#This Data set was created to aalyze the corellation between automatic and manual cars.This was made to seek the difference between the two and as to which gets better miles per galleon. The mtcars dataset was used for this.

## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```data(mtcars)
head(mtcars)
mtcars$cyl  <- factor(mtcars$cyl)
mtcars$vs   <- factor(mtcars$vs)
mtcars$gear <- factor(mtcars$gear)
mtcars$carb <- factor(mtcars$carb)
mtcars$am   <- factor(mtcars$am,labels=c("Automatic","Manual"))
summary(mtcars$mpg)
lrm <- lm(mpg ~ factor(am), data=mtcars)
summary(lrm)
mrm <- lm(mpg ~ . ,data=mtcars)
summary(mrm)
data(mtcars)
cor(mtcars)[1,]
finalrm <- lm(mpg ~ wt+hp+disp+cyl+am, data = mtcars)
boxplot(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars, col = (c("yellow","blue")), ylab = "Miles Per Gallon", xlab = "Transmission Type")
pairs(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars)
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```plot("mtcars")

plot(finalrm)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
